/**
 * This class is a MimeType repository. It gathers a set of MimeTypes and
 * enables to retrieves a content-type from its name, from a file name, or from
 * a magic character sequence.
 * <p>
 * The MIME type detection methods that take an {@link InputStream} as
 * an argument will never reads more than {@link #getMinLength()} bytes
 * from the stream. Also the given stream is never
 * {@link InputStream#close() closed}, {@link InputStream#mark(int) marked},
 * or {@link InputStream#reset() reset} by the methods. Thus a client can
 * use the {@link InputStream#markSupported() mark feature} of the stream
 * (if available) to restore the stream back to the state it was before type
 * detection if it wants to process the stream based on the detected type.
